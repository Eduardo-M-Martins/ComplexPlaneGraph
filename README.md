# ComplexPlaneGraph
By Eduardo Machado Martins

## Description
This application aims to explore the complex plane visualization with a heat map of the roots of a polynomial equation. Three graphics are ploted, the first with the roots on the complex plane, the second is the polynomial visualization and tha last is the absolute polynomail visaulization. On the complex plane graph, when a root is located right on the white axis, that means that the root is real, otherwise is a complex root. The polynomial equation is deffined in the code and can be modified. In addition, the animations is made by adding a 'i' value on the equation, to pause the animation press space key. For a plot without animation just remove the 'i' value from the polynomial equation.

## Dependencies
This application uses Python, Numpy, Matplotlib and Keyboard.

## Execution
The following command execute the application.
```
python3 complex.py
```
